## Use of Github and pushing the initial application

I generated the Rails application using

    rails new quiz

And a basic controller for a placeholder welcome page:

    cd rails
    bin/rails generate controller welcome index 
    
I created a git repository on my Github account to store the project: https://github.com/sandeel/humble-quiz-app
    
I then initialised a git repository

    git init

And added the remote origin

    git remote add origin git@github.com:sandeel/humble-quiz-app.git
    
I then pushed my initial project to github

    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin master


## Database architecture: Models and Migrations

Ruby's `rake` command was used to generate the models for the application.

Examples:

    bin/rails generate model Quiz title:string                          
    
to create a model for a quiz. It consists of only a title because the rest of a
quiz is composed of other entities, eg. Question, Attempt.

    bin/rails generate model Question text:string quiz:references
    
for creating a Question which represents a quiz question with text for the question
text.

    bin/rails generate model Attempt quiz:references result:integer

for creating a model for Attempt which represents an attempt at a quiz. The model
contains a foreign key to the quiz the attempt is on and an integer representing
the score the user got on the quiz.

Migrations were used to modify existing models as so:

    bin/rails g migration AddCorrectAnswerToQuestions correct_answer:int
    
This modified the Question model to add an extra field for the correct answer
to the question.

## External Gems
### Gaffe
Gaffe was used to generate custom error pages for Rails. More details on this below.




## Custom error handling pages

Gaffe was installed on my machine using

    sudo gem install gaffe

Gaffe was then added to the project by adding the following line to the Gemfile:

    gem 'gaffe'
    
Gaffe was then added to initializers by creating a file called gaffe.rb in 
config/initializers with the following content:

    Gaffe.enable!
    
To allow me to test the error pages in development mode I had to edit
`config/environments/test.rb` and change the option `config.consider_all_requests_local`
to `true`.

The following is an example of an error page generated by Gaffe. To get an error
page, simple try to navigate to a quiz with an id which doesn't exist (see figure 1.)
